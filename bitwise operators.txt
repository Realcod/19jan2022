/*
Bitwise operators are useful when we want to work with bits. Here, we'll take a look at them.

Given three positive integers a, b and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. e = ~e

	int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h;
	cout<<"Enter a,b,c "<<endl;
	cin>>a>>b>>c;
	
	d= a^a;
	e=c^b;
	f= a&b;
	g= c|(a^a);
